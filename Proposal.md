The purpose of our project is to create a pipeline in python3 and bash that will compare  /
the complete sequences of COVID-19 collected from different countries and different date /
to analyse the genome structure and estimate the evolution and spread of COVID-19. 

For our project we are:
1. Downloading all complete genome sequences from NCBI: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/
2. Estimating genome structures like: genome size, G+C content, genome signature and so on
3. Comparing genome stuctures (create heat map):
 a. find ORFS
 b. find variations
 c. find central conserved regions
4. Constructing phylogenetic trees

We have the following members in our groups:
 Cierla McGuire Sams
 Isaac Mcneely
